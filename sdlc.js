// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning 
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis of Requirements = "This phase focuses on identifying and documents detailed functions and non-functional requirments of the software/program"
const Design = "In this phase you plan the components, architecture and data models ei flowcharts and mockups"
const Implementation = "at this phase you will start to write the code following the designs specifics"
const Testing & Integration = "towards the final phase, here you will perform various test to ensure the software/program is free of bugs etc"
const Maintain = "The last and final stage, this phase begins after deployment. this consist of monitoring and fixing ny bugs that my arise"
